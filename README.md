# PacMen
This is the PacMen exercise for MIT's Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN course. This nostalgic project will deploy pac men who move randomly.

Open the HTML file to view the webpage. Click on the screen to deploy another pac man.

What else can I deploy? Perhaps some music notes that just float away... Or can I get all crazy and deploy eyes? Time will tell.

This project is licensed through MIT as described in the repository documents.
